## A PowerShell Conversion Challenge

In this article, the last in a series on my solution to the IronScripter [PowerShell Conversion Challenge][IronScripterChallenge]{:target="_blank"},
I will be exploring and solving for the remaining requirements.
In [part 1][SolutionPart1]{:target="_blank"}, I solved 7 primary requirements and 1 personal requirement.
In [part 2][SolutionPart2]{:target="_blank"}, I solved 3 personal requirements, which included converting property and class names to PascalCase, detecting property types, and hiding properties.

Primary challenge requirements:

- Insert placeholder for methods
- Let the user specify a method
- Be VSCode aware and insert the new class automatically into the current file

My personal requirements:

- Should be recursive.
  - Any object that contains a property which is itself another complex object should generate a separate class definition.
- Contained in a small module, as there will be a few helper functions.

## Part 3 - The Final Solution

Here is my current `ConvertTo-ClassDefinition` function.

And here is a sample output from `Get-TwitterUser -ScreenName thedavecarroll | ConvertTo-ClassDefinition -ClassName 'BluebirdPSUser' -HiddenProperty 'id_str'`.

## Summary

I originally thought this article was going to complete the challenge but, as I mentioned above, I'm not done.

In this one, I focused on some of my own requirements, namely enforcing PascalCase for class and property names, resolution of property types that are generically cast as `string` objects, and allowing the user to specify properties to hide.

In the next article, I plan to explore and cover the remaining requirements:
